## 🏆 Key Features to Highlight

### For Technical Interviews

**Architecture & Design Patterns**:
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking I/O
- Dependency injection for testability (FastAPI)
- Repository pattern for data access (SQLAlchemy)
- Middleware pattern for cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth)
- Factory pattern for service initialization

**Data Structures & Algorithms**:
- Vector embeddings (1536-dimensional space)
- Cosine similarity / L2 distance for ranking
- HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor search (O(log n))
- Sliding window rate limiting algorithm
- Deterministic ranking with multi-field sorting

**System Design Decisions**:
- Why deterministic embeddings? (reproducibility, no external deps, privacy)
- Why PostgreSQL + pgvector? (ACID transactions, unified storage)
- Why Redis for queue? (in-memory speed, RQ integration)
- Trade-offs: Embedding quality vs. speed/cost

**Scalability Considerations**:
- Horizontal API scaling (stateless design)
- Database read replicas for search queries
- Connection pooling to prevent exhaustion
- Async I/O throughout (asyncpg, httpx)
- Caching strategy (idempotency, search results)

**Security Measures**:
- Defense in depth (multiple layers)
- Principle of least privilege (role-based access)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and account lockout
- Audit logging for compliance

### For Behavioral Interviews

**Problem-Solving Example**:
*"How did you handle PII encryption requirements?"*

"I designed a field-level encryption system using Fernet (AES-128-CBC) that encrypts sensitive data before storing in the database. The challenge was balancing security with query performance. I solved this by:
1. Encrypting only specific fields (email, name) vs. entire records
2. Storing encrypted data in separate `pii_store` table for isolation
3. Implementing caching to avoid repeated decryption
4. Adding role-based decryption (admins see full data, users see redacted)
5. Creating audit logs for all PII access for compliance

This approach provided strong security while maintaining <500ms query latency."

**Collaboration Example**:
*"How did you ensure code quality?"*

"I established a comprehensive review process:
- All changes via PRs with detailed descriptions
- Automated CI checks (tests, linting, security scans) required to pass
- Code review checklist (functionality, tests, docs, security)
- Documentation updates required for API changes
- OpenAPI spec auto-generation to keep docs in sync

This caught 20+ potential issues before production and ensured consistent code quality."

**Learning Example**:
*"What was the hardest technical challenge?"*

"Implementing distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry was challenging because I needed to understand:
- Context propagation across async operations
- Span lifecycle management
- OTLP exporter configuration
- Integration with FastAPI middleware

I overcame this by:
1. Reading OpenTelemetry documentation thoroughly
2. Experimenting with simple examples first
3. Gradually adding instrumentation to key operations
4. Validating traces in Jaeger UI
5. Creating helper functions to simplify instrumentation

This resulted in full request tracing from frontend → API → database, enabling sub-second debugging of production issues."

• Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
• Account lockout protection against brute force

📊 Production-Ready Observability:
• 13+ Prometheus metrics (HTTP, business logic, queue, errors)
• OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with request correlation
• Structured JSON logging with PII masking
• Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
• <500ms average query latency, <1s p99

🧪 Quality Standards:
• 90%+ test coverage (28 unit/integration tests)
• CI/CD with GitHub Actions (tests, security scans, deploys)
